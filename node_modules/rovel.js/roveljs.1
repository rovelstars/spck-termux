--About--

This package was mainly meant to learn about npm features, but it became a great project that everyone loves!
It was made in the free time, so we could help others with some features that they wanted.
We can proudly say that rovel.js dosen't needs compiling, and it's made so simple so contributors can contribute to us!
We used Android device to work on this project.
- Spck Editor (For editing bigger codes)
- Termux (Linux Terminal on Android)
Without the support of the above apps, we couldn't accomplish this great work!
